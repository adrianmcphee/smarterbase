# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for SmarterBase.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand:
- **Why** a decision was made
- **What alternatives** were considered
- **What consequences** resulted from the decision

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Short descriptive name
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change we're proposing or have agreed to
- **Consequences**: The results of applying this decision (positive, negative, neutral)

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [0001](0001-schema-versioning-and-migrations.md) | Schema Versioning and Migrations | Accepted | 2025-10-12 |
